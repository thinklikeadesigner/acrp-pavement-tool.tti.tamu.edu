   <h3>Disintegration</h3>
      <p>Disintegration in a flexible pavement is typically caused by climate, insufficient compaction of the surface, insufficient asphalt binder in the mix, loss of adhesion between the asphalt coating and aggregate particles, or severe overheating of the mix. The following types of disintegration commonly occur.</p>

      <h4>Types:</h4>
      
      <div class="type type2"><a id="weathering" name="weathering"></a>
        <h5>Weathering</h5>
        <p>Weathering is the wearing away of the asphalt binder and fine aggregate matrix from the pavement surface. The asphalt surface begins to show signs of aging which may be accelerated by climatic conditions. Loss of fine aggregate matrix is noticeable and may be accompanied by fading of the asphalt pavement color.</p>

<div class="type type1" style="clear:both;"><a id="raveling" name="raveling"></a>
        <h5>Raveling</h5>
        <p>Raveling is the wearing away of the pavement surface caused by the dislodging of aggregate particles. This distress may indicate that the asphalt binder has aged and hardened significantly. As the raveling continues, larger pieces break free, and the pavement takes on a rough and jagged appearance which can produce a significant source for FOD.</p>

    <!--  <div class="type type3"><a id="potholes" name="potholes"></a>
        <h5>Potholes</h5>
        <p>A pothole is defined as a disruption in the pavement surface where a portion of the pavement material has broken away, leaving a hole. Most potholes are caused by fatigue of the pavement surface. As fatigue cracks develop, they interlock forming alligator cracking. When the sections of cracked pavement work loose, they may eventually be picked out of the surface by continued wheel loads, and form a pothole. In northern climates, where freeze-thaw cycles are severe, pothole development is exacerbated due to the continuous freeze- thaw action and may not be related solely to traffic patterns. Although possible, potholes are not a common distress to airfields.</p>

    <!--  <div class="type type4"><a id="asphalt-stripping" name="asphalt-stripping"></a>
        <h5>Asphalt stripping</h5>
        <p>Asphalt stripping is caused by moisture infiltration into the HMA pavement structure leading to “stripping” of the bituminous binder from the aggregate particles. Asphalt stripping of HMA pavements may also be caused by cyclic water-vapor pressures within the mixture scrubbing the binder from the aggregates.</p>

   <!--   <div class="type type5"><a id="jet-blast" name="jet-blast"></a>
        <h5>Jet blast erosion</h5>
        <p>Jet blast erosion is defined as a darkened area of pavement surface where the bituminous binder has been burned or carbonized. Localized burned areas may vary in depth up to approximately 1/2-inch (13 mm).</p>

      <div class="type type6"><a id="patching" name="patching"></a>
        <h5>Patching</h5>
        <p>A patch is defined as an area where the original pavement has been removed and replaced by a filler material. Deterioration of a patch typically progresses at a higher rate than the original pavement. Deterioration of patch areas affects the ride quality and creates FOD potential.</p>

      <h3>Cracking</h3>
      <p>Cracks in flexible pavements are caused by deflection of the surface over an unstable foundation, shrinkage of the surface, thermal expansion and contraction of the surface, poorly constructed lane joints, or reflection cracking. The following types of cracks commonly occur in flexible pavements.</p>

      <h4>Types:</h4>

      <div class="type type1"><a id="long" name="long"></a>
        <h5>Longitudinal Cracking</h5>
        <p>Longitudinal cracks may result from shrinkage or contraction of the HMA surface. Shrinkage of the surface material is caused by oxidation and age hardening of the asphalt material. Contraction is caused by thermal fluctuations. Poorly constructed paving lane joints may accelerate the development of longitudinal joint cracks. This type of cracking is not load associated.</p>

        <p>Transverse cracks may result from shrinkage or contraction of the HMA surface. Shrinkage of the surface material is caused by oxidation and age hardening of the asphalt material. Contraction is caused by thermal fluctuations. </p>

      <div class="type type4"><a id="block" name="block"></a>
        <h5>Block Cracking</h5>
        <p>Block cracks are interconnected cracks that divide the pavement into approximately rectangular pieces. The blocks may range in size from approximately 1 foot by 1 foot (0.3 m by 0.3 m) to 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m). Block cracking is caused mainly by contraction of the asphalt and daily temperature cycling that results in daily stress/strain cycling. It is not load associated. The occurrence of block cracking usually indicates that the asphalt has hardened significantly. Block cracking normally occurs over a large portion of pavement area, but sometimes will occur only in non-traffic areas. Block cracking differs from alligator cracking.</p>

    <div class="type type5"><a id="reflection" name="reflection"></a>
        <h5>Reflection Cracking</h5>
        <p>Vertical or horizontal movement in the pavement beneath an overlay cause this type of distress. This movement may be due to expansion and contraction caused by temperature and moisture changes or traffic loads. The cracks in HMA overlays reflect the crack pattern or joint pattern in the underlying pavement. They occur most frequently in HMA overlays on PCC pavements. However, they may also occur on overlays of HMA pavements when cracks or joints in the old pavement have not been properly repaired.</p>

      <div class="type type6"><a id="alligator" name="alligator"></a>
        <h5>Alligator (Fatigue) Cracking</h5>
        <p>Alligator (fatigue) cracking is a series of interconnecting cracks caused by fatigue failure of the HMA surface under repeated traffic loading. The cracking begins at the bottom of the HMA surface (or stabilized base) where tensile stress and strain are highest under a wheel load. The cracks propagate to the surface initially as a series of parallel cracks. After repeated traffic loading or excessive deflection of the HMA surface over a weakened or under-designed foundation or interlayer, the cracks connect, forming many sided sharp angled pieces that develop a pattern resembling chicken wire or alligator skin. The pieces are less than 2 feet (0.6 m) on the longest side.</p>

        <p>Slippage cracks appear when braking or turning wheels cause the pavement surface to slide and deform. This usually occurs when there is a low-strength surface mix or poor bond between the surface and the next layer of the pavement structure. These cracks are crescent or half-moon-shaped with the two ends pointing away from the direction of traffic.</p>

      <h3>Joint seal damage</h3>
      <p>Joint seal damage is any condition that enables incompressible foreign material such as soil or rocks to accumulate in the joints or that allows infiltration of water. Accumulation of foreign materials prevents the slabs from expanding and may result in buckling, shattering, or spalling. Water infiltration through joint seal damage can cause pumping or deterioration of the base. Typical types of joint seal damage include stripping of joint sealant, extrusion of joint sealant, hardening of the filler (oxidation), loss of bond to the slab edges, and absence of sealant in the joint. Joint seal damage is caused by improper joint width, use of the wrong type of sealant, incorrect application, not properly cleaning the joint before sealing, and/or climate (aging).</p>

      <h3>Disintegration</h3>
      <p>Disintegration is the breaking up of a pavement into small, loose pieces including the dislodging of aggregate particles. Improper curing and finishing of the concrete, unsuitable aggregates, and improper mixing of the concrete can cause this distress. Disintegration typically falls into the following categories.</p>

      <h4>Types:</h4>

     <!-- <div class="type type1"><a id="scaling" name="scaling"></a>
        <h5>Scaling, map cracking, and crazing</h5>
        <p>Scaling is the disintegration and loss of the wearing surface. A surface weakened by improper curing or finishing and freeze-thaw cycles can lead to scaling. Map cracking or crazing refers to a network of shallow hairline cracks that extend only through the upper surface of the concrete. Crazing usually results from improper curing and/or finishing of the concrete and may lead to scaling of the surface.</p>

      </div> --><!-- end .type.type1 -->

     <!-- <div class="type type2"><a id="asr" name="asr"></a>
        <h5>Alkali-Silica Reactivity (ASR)</h5>
        <p>ASR is another source of distress associated with map cracking. ASR is caused by an expansive reaction between alkalis and certain reactive silica minerals, which forms a gel. The gel absorbs water, causing expansion, which may damage the concrete and adjacent structures. Alkalis are most often introduced by the portland cement within the pavement. ASR may be indicated by cracking of the concrete pavement (often in a map pattern); white, brown, gray or other colored gel or staining that may be present at the crack surface; and/or an increase in concrete volume (expansion) that may result in distortion of adjacent or integral structures or physical elements.</p>

      <div class="type type3"><a id="joint-spalling" name="joint-spalling"></a>
        <h5>Joint Spalling</h5>
        <p>Joint spalling is the breakdown of the slab edges within 2 feet (0.6 m) of the side of the joint. A joint spall usually does not extend vertically through the slab but intersects the joint at an angle. Joint spalling often results from excessive stresses at the joint or crack caused by infiltration of incompressible materials or weak concrete at the joint (caused by overworking) combined with traffic loads. Joint spalling also results when dowels, which prevent slab movement, become misaligned either through improper placement or improper slippage preparation.</p>

        <h5>Corner Spalling</h5>
        <p>Corner spalling is the raveling or breakdown of the slab within approximately 2 feet (0.6 m) of the corner. It differs from a corner break in that the spall usually angles downward to intersect the joint, while a break extends vertically through the slab. The same mechanisms that cause joint spalling often cause corner spalling, but this type of distress may appear sooner because of increased exposure.</p>

     <!-- <div class="type type5"><a id="blowups" name="blowups"></a>
        <h5>Blowups</h5>
        <p>Blowups, although not common, usually occur at a transverse crack or joint that is not wide enough to permit expansion of the concrete slabs. Insufficient width may result from infiltration of incompressible materials into the joint space or by gradual closure of the joint caused by expansion of the concrete due to ASR. When expansive pressure cannot be relieved, a localized upward movement of the slab edges (buckling) or shattering will occur in the vicinity of the joint. Blowups normally occur only in thin pavement sections, although blowups can also appear at drainage structures (manholes, inlets, etc.). The frequency and severity of blowups may increase with an asphalt overlay due to the additional heat absorbed by the dark asphalt surface. They generally occur during hot weather because of the additional thermal expansion of the concrete.</p>

        <h5>Popouts</h5>
        <p>A popout is defined as a small piece of pavement that breaks loose from the concrete surface. This is caused by freeze-thaw action in combination with expansive aggregates and can be caused by ASR. Popouts usually range from approximately 1 to 4 inches (2.5 to 10 cm) in diameter and from 1/2 to 2 inches (1.3 to 5 cm) deep. A popout may also be caused by a singular piece of large aggregate that breaks loose from the concrete surface or caused by clay balls in the concrete mix.</p>

        <p>A patch is defined as an area where the original pavement has been removed and replaced by a filler material. Deterioration of a patch typically progresses at a higher rate than the original pavement. Patching is usually divided into two types: \n(a) Small. A small patch is defined as an area less than 5 ft² (0.5 m²). \n(b) Large and utility cuts. A large patch is defined as an area greater than 5 ft² (0.5 m²). A utility cut is defined as a patch that has replaced the original pavement due to placement of underground utilities.</p>

      <h3>Cracking</h3>
      <p>Cracks in rigid pavements often result from stresses caused by expansion and contraction or warping of the pavement. Overloading, loss of subgrade support, and insufficient and/or improperly cut joints acting singly or in combination are also possible causes. The following types of cracking typically occur in rigid pavements.</p>

        <h5>Corner Breaks</h5>
        <p>Load repetition, combined with loss of support and curling stresses, usually causes cracks at the slab corner. The lack of support may be caused by pumping or loss of load transfer at the joint. Corner breaks are characterized by a crack that intersects the joints at a distance less than or equal to one-half of the slab length on both sides, measured from the corner of the slab. A corner break differs from a corner spall in that the break extends vertically through the entire slab thickness; a corner spall intersects the joint at an angle.</p>

      <!--<div class="type type3"><a id="d-cracking" name="d-cracking"></a>
        <h5>Durability “D” cracking</h5>
        <p>D cracking usually appears as a pattern of cracks running in the vicinity of and parallel to a joint or linear crack. It is caused by the concrete’s inability to withstand environmental factors such as freeze-thaw cycles because of variable expansive aggregates. This type of cracking may eventually lead to disintegration of the concrete within 1 to 2 feet (0.3 m to 0.6 m) of the joint or crack.</p>

        <h5>Shrinkage cracking</h5>
        <p>Shrinkage cracks are hairline cracks that are usually only a few feet long and do not extend across the entire slab. They are formed during the setting and curing of the concrete and usually do not extend through the depth of the slab. Typically, shrinkage cracks do not extend greater than 1/4-inch (6 mm) from the slab surface and may be primarily in the finished surface paste only.</p>
