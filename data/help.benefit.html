<strong>Relative Benefit</strong> is defined as the sum of the condition (expressed as a PCI score) after applying a treatment, minus the condition had the treatment not been applied (expressed as a net PCI increase) summed for each year until the PCI score with treatment reaches the threshold value of 40, and reported as PCI-Years.

<strong>Benefit/Cost</strong> is the ratio of the relative benefit described above, to the cost of treatment for a single sample unit.  The following is an example of the cost calculation:
</p>

<p>
If the distress was “Transverse cracks spaced 20 feet apart Medium severity”, the treatment was “Crack seal/fill”, with the default cost of crack sealing at $0.75/linear foot, the quantity of crack sealing for transverse cracks spaced at 20 feet was defined to be 500 feet, the cost was determined to be 250 feet * $0.75/linear feet or $187.50.  The benefit for this case was calculated to be 119 (PCI-Years) and Benefit/Cost was 0.64.
