Alligator or fatigue cracking is a series of interconnecting
cracks caused by fatigue failure of the asphalt surface
under repeated traffic loading. The cracking initiates at the
bottom of the asphalt surface (or stabilized base) where
tensile stress and strain is highest under a wheel load.
The cracks propagate to the surface initially as a series of
parallel cracks. After repeated traffic loading, the cracks
connect and form multi-sided, sharp-angled pieces that
develop a pattern resembling chicken wire or the skin of an
alligator. The pieces are less than 2 feet (0.6 meters) on the
longest side. Alligator cracking occurs only in areas that are
subjected to repeated traffic loadings, such as wheel paths.
Therefore, it would not occur over an entire area unless the
entire area was subjected to traffic loading. (Pattern-type
cracking, which occurs over an entire area that is not subject
to loading, is rated as block cracking, which is not a load
associated distress.) Alligator cracking is considered a major
structural distress.
