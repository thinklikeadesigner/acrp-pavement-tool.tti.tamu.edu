These cracks, which divide the slab into two or three pieces, are usually caused by a combination of load repetition, curling stresses, and shrinkage stresses. (For slabs divided into four or more pieces, see Shattered Slab/ Intersecting Cracks.) Low severity cracks are usually warping or friction related and are not considered major structural distresses. Medium or high severity cracks are usually working cracks and are considered major structural distresses.  Hairline cracks that are only a few feet long and do not extend across the entire slab are rated as shrinkage cracks.
