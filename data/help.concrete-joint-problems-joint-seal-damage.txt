Joint seal damage is any condition that enables incompressible foreign material such as soil or rocks to accumulate in the joints or that allows infiltration of water. Accumulation of foreign materials prevents the slabs from expanding and may result in buckling, shattering, or spalling. Water infiltration through joint seal damage can cause pumping or deterioration of the base. Typical types of joint seal damage include stripping of joint sealant, extrusion of joint sealant, hardening of the filler (oxidation), loss of bond to the slab edges, and absence of sealant in the joint. Joint seal damage is caused by improper joint width, use of the wrong type of sealant, incorrect application, not properly cleaning the joint before sealing, and/or climate (aging).
