A patch is defined as an area where the original pavement has been removed and replaced by a filler material. Deterioration of a patch typically progresses at a higher rate than the original pavement. Patching is usually divided into two types: \n(a) Small. A small patch is defined as an area less than 5 ft² (0.5 m²). \n(b) Large and utility cuts. A large patch is defined as an area greater than 5 ft² (0.5 m²). A utility cut is defined as a patch that has replaced the original pavement due to placement of underground utilities.
