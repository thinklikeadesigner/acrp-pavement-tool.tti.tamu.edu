Raveling is the wearing away of the pavement surface caused by the dislodging of aggregate particles. This distress may indicate that the asphalt binder has aged and hardened significantly. As the raveling continues, larger pieces break free, and the pavement takes on a rough and jagged appearance which can produce a significant source for FOD.
