Load repetition, combined with loss of support and curling stresses, usually causes cracks at the slab corner. The lack of support may be caused by pumping or loss of load transfer at the joint. Corner breaks are characterized by a crack that intersects the joints at a distance less than or equal to one-half of the slab length on both sides, measured from the corner of the slab. A corner break differs from a corner spall in that the break extends vertically through the entire slab thickness; a corner spall intersects the joint at an angle.
