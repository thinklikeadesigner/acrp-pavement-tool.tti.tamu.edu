This distress occurs only on pavements having an asphalt
or tar surface over a PCC slab. This category does not
include reflection cracking from any other type of base (i.e.,
cement stabilized, lime stabilized); such cracks are listed as
longitudinal and transverse cracks. Joint reflection cracking
is caused mainly by movement of the PCC slab beneath
the AC surface because of thermal and moisture changes;
it is not load related. However, traffic loading may cause
a breakdown of the AC near the crack, resulting in spalling
and FOD potential. If the pavement is fragmented along a
crack, the crack is said to be spalled. A knowledge of slab
dimensions beneath the AC surface will help to identify these
cracks.
