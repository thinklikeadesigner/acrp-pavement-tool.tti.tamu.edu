•	Text labeling photos is very difficult to read on thumbnails.
•	Photos don’t seem to be organized from low to high severity in all distress types.  Rearranging would help the users understand better.
•	Features of this program are much improved.  Thank you.

While this info is helpful to show how the recommendation was obtained, I think it would be very helpful to have a neat and tidy recommendation page that cleanly displays all of the basic information that was entered and includes the recommendation the shown in the final analysis table.  I can’t imagine any airport manager sharing the output as currently presented to their City Council or other governing body in the current format.  Maybe this needs to be split into two print options, technical and summary?
