Corner spalling is the raveling or breakdown of the slab within approximately 2 feet (0.6 m) of the corner. It differs from a corner break in that the spall usually angles downward to intersect the joint, while a break extends vertically through the slab. The same mechanisms that cause joint spalling often cause corner spalling, but this type of distress may appear sooner because of increased exposure.
