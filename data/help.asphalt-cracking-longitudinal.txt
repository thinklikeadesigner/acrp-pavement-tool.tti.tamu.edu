Longitudinal cracks are parallel to the pavementâ€™s centerline
or laydown direction. They may be caused by (1) a poorly
constructed paving lane joint, (2) shrinkage of the AC surface
due to low temperatures or hardening of the asphalt, or (3)
a reflective crack caused by cracks beneath the surface
course, including cracks in PCC slabs (but not at PCC
joints).
