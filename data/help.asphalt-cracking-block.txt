Block cracks are interconnected cracks that divide the
pavement into approximately rectangular pieces. The blocks
may range in size from approximately 1 by 1 foot to 10 by
10 feet (0.3 by 0.3 meters to 3 by 3 meters). Block cracking
is caused mainly by shrinkage of the asphalt concrete (AC)
and daily temperature cycling (which results in daily stress/
strain cycling). It is not load associated. The occurrence
of block cracking usually indicates that the asphalt has
hardened significantly. Block cracking normally occurs over
a large proportion of pavement area but sometimes will
occur in non-traffic areas. This type of distress differs from
alligator cracking in that alligator cracks form smaller, multisided
pieces with sharp angles. Also, unlike block cracks,
alligator cracks are caused by repeated traffic loadings and,
therefore, are located only in traffic areas (i.e., wheel paths).
